Author: Karen Berba

## Language(s)
C++

## Description
Recreates Chris Langtonâ€™s two-dimensional universal Turing machine. After starting the
simulation, the user is prompted to enter how large the board is, the amount of
steps they want the simulation to run for, where to place the ant, and when the
game ends, whether they want to play again/quit.

* NOTE: Works best on a 70x70 board at 11000 steps

## How to run:
Compile Ant.cpp and mainAnt.cpp together.
